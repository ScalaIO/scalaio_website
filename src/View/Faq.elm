The money from tickets sales and sponsors is used solely to pay for the conference hall, the food, the technical setup (speaker amplification, video projectors, video recording), some swag, and as much T&E covering as possible for speakers who can't get backing from a company. Should money remain after the conference, it will be used to further compensate speakers. In the event that there would still be some money left afterward, it would be used for the next ScalaIO." ]
